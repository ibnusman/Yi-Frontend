# Yi-Frontend

## Overview
This is the frontend for the Notes App, built with React and Vite. It allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The app communicates with a backend API to persist data.

## Features
- Add new notes with a title and content.
- View all saved notes.
- Delete notes when no longer needed.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Pages & User Interaction
### Home Page (`/`)
- Displays all notes retrieved from the backend.
- Users can add a new note using the input form.
- Each note has a delete button to remove it from the list.

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>

3. Start the development server:
